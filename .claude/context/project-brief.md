# Project Brief

## What is Lumara?

Lumara is a **metacognitive AI partner** that helps you build personal truth by tracking how your understanding evolves over time.

## The Problem

Knowledge tools store **what sources say**. But sources don't change - **your understanding does**. When you read "continental grip for serves" on day 1, you understand it one way. Three months later, after practice and contradiction resolution, you understand it completely differently.

**No existing tool tracks this evolution.**

## The Solution

Lumara tracks:
1. **The source** (unchanging): "Coach said continental grip"
2. **Your interpretation** (evolving): "I understood it as X, then Y, then Z"
3. **Your testing** (confidence): "Tested 50 times, 85% success rate"
4. **Your truth** (synthesized): "Works for flat serves with flexible wrist"

## Why It Matters

- **Better Decisions:** Know what you actually know vs. what you assume
- **Faster Learning:** See what changed your understanding
- **Intellectual Growth:** Watch your thinking evolve over time
- **Personal Truth:** Build knowledge you can actually trust

## Target Market

- Knowledge workers ($40/month tier)
- Skill learners ($30/month tier)
- Researchers ($20/month student tier)

## Success Criteria

Users say: "I can see how my thinking actually evolved. This isn't just notes - it's my intellectual journey."
