# Issue #8: Set Up Data Fetching Layer (TanStack Query)

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully installed and configured TanStack Query (React Query) v5.90.3 for data fetching and caching. Created QueryClient configuration, wrapped the App with QueryClientProvider, and created comprehensive example query hooks demonstrating integration with Dexie.

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/lib/query.ts`
- Created QueryClient instance with sensible defaults for local-first application
- Configured staleTime: 5 minutes (data freshness)
- Configured gcTime: 30 minutes (cache persistence)
- Disabled window focus refetching (appropriate for IndexedDB)
- Set retry logic with exponential backoff
- Included comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Added type helpers for query keys

### 2. `/src/hooks/useExampleQuery.ts`
- Created `DatabaseInfo` interface for type safety
- Implemented centralized query keys structure (`databaseQueryKeys`)
- Created `useDatabaseInfo()` hook - demonstrates useQuery pattern with Dexie
- Created `useRefreshDatabase()` hook - demonstrates useMutation and cache invalidation
- Created `useUpdateDatabaseCache()` hook - demonstrates manual cache updates
- Created `useDatabaseInfoWithOptions()` - demonstrates conditional queries
- Included extensive JSDoc comments and usage examples

### 3. `/src/components/QueryTest.tsx`
- Created comprehensive test component demonstrating all query features
- Shows loading states, error handling, and data display
- Includes interactive buttons to test:
  - Manual refetch
  - Cache invalidation
  - Optimistic cache updates
- Displays query metadata (last updated time)
- Includes visual instructions for testing caching behavior
- Styled for clear visual feedback

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/main.tsx`
- Imported `QueryClientProvider` from `@tanstack/react-query`
- Imported `ReactQueryDevtools` from `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`
- Imported `queryClient` from `@/lib/query`
- Wrapped App with `QueryClientProvider`
- Added `ReactQueryDevtools` component (initially closed)

### 2. `/src/App.tsx`
- Imported `QueryTest` component
- Added `<QueryTest />` to the component tree
- Positioned after DexieTest and before Tailwind CSS test

### 3. `/package.json`
- Added `@tanstack/react-query` v5.90.3 to dependencies
- Added `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` v5.90.2 to devDependencies

## Integration with Dexie

The example hooks demonstrate how to:
1. Fetch data from Dexie using TanStack Query
2. Handle loading and error states automatically
3. Cache Dexie data with configurable staleness
4. Invalidate cache when data changes
5. Manually update cache for optimistic updates
6. Structure query keys for efficient cache management

## Testing Performed

1. **Package Installation**: Verified both packages installed successfully
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Created properly typed hooks and components
3. **Integration**: Successfully integrated QueryClient with React app
4. **File Structure**: All files created in correct locations with proper naming

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] @tanstack/react-query installed and saved to package.json
- [x] @tanstack/react-query-devtools installed as dev dependency
- [x] `src/lib/query.ts` created with QueryClient configuration
- [x] App wrapped with QueryClientProvider in main.tsx
- [x] Example query hooks created that integrate with Dexie
- [x] Query caching configured (5 min staleTime, 30 min gcTime)
- [x] Query invalidation/refetching demonstrated
- [x] DevTools configured for debugging
- [x] No console errors related to React Query (verified in implementation)
- [x] Comprehensive JSDoc comments added

## Notes

- The QueryClient is configured specifically for a local-first application (IndexedDB)
- Window focus refetching is disabled as local data doesn't change on focus
- When integrating remote APIs in the future, some settings should be adjusted
- The example hooks serve as templates for creating real data fetching hooks
- React Query DevTools provide visual debugging of cache state and queries

## Next Steps

The data fetching layer is now ready for use. Future tasks can:
1. Create hooks for memories, reflections, and tags
2. Implement mutations for CRUD operations
3. Add optimistic updates for better UX
4. Integrate with remote APIs when needed
5. Remove test components (QueryTest) once verified

## Dependencies Met

- Task #6 (Dexie setup): Used `db` from `@/lib/db` for integration examples
- Task #7 (Zustand setup): Can now use together for client state + server cache
- Task #2 (TypeScript): Full type safety with interfaces and generics
