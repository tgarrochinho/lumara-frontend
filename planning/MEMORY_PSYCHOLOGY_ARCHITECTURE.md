# Memory Psychology Architecture

**Created:** January 2025
**Purpose:** Map NexusMind's architecture to actual cognitive psychology principles

*This document explains how NexusMind mirrors human memory systems, making it a true cognitive prosthetic rather than just another note-taking app.*

## 🧠 The Science: Human Memory Types

### Core Memory Systems (from Psychology Research)

```yaml
1. Sensory Memory (< 1 second)
   - Raw sensory input
   - Not consciously accessible
   - Filters what enters awareness

2. Working Memory (15-30 seconds)
   - Active processing zone
   - Limited capacity: 7±2 items (Miller's Law)
   - Manipulation and reasoning happens here

3. Long-Term Memory (permanent storage)
   ├─ Episodic: Personal experiences with context
   │   "I learned this from my coach on Tuesday"
   │
   ├─ Semantic: Facts without personal context
   │   "Continental grip is used for serves"
   │
   └─ Procedural: How-to knowledge
       "How to execute a kick serve"
```

## 🏗️ NexusMind Architecture Mapping

### Direct Implementation of Memory Psychology

```yaml
Human Memory → NexusMind Component
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sensory Memory
→ Chat Input Field (transient text as you type)

Working Memory
→ Working Memory Sidebar
  - Shows current session's active ideas
  - Enforces 7±2 limit visually
  - "Working Memory: 5/7" indicator

Long-Term Memory
→ Knowledge Base (three distinct types)

  Episodic Memory
  → Chat Sessions & Timeline
    - Preserves when/where/context
    - "Tuesday's coaching session"
    - Emotional context retained

  Semantic Memory
  → Themes/Concepts
    - Decontextualized facts
    - "Continental grip technique"
    - Organized by meaning

  Procedural Memory
  → Playbooks/Methods
    - Step-by-step instructions
    - "My serve routine"
    - Actionable sequences
```

## 💡 Unique Memory Phenomena We Implement

### 1. Memory Reconsolidation

**The Science:**
When you recall a memory, it becomes temporarily unstable and can be modified before being restored.

**Our Implementation:**
```typescript
// When user revisits old knowledge
artifact: {
  originalUnderstanding: "Continental grip for all serves",
  reconsolidations: [
    {
      date: "2025-02-01",
      newUnderstanding: "Continental for flat serves only",
      trigger: "Practice session revealed nuance"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. The Testing Effect

**The Science:**
Testing retrieval strengthens memory more than repeated study.

**Our Implementation:**
- Contradiction resolution = forced retrieval
- Outcome tracking = testing in practice
- Confidence scores = based on successful retrievals

### 3. Elaborative Encoding

**The Science:**
Connecting new information to existing knowledge creates stronger memories.

**Our Implementation:**
```yaml
New Input: "Use eastern grip for kick serves"
System: ⚠️ Contradicts existing knowledge
User Elaborates: "Both true - continental for flat, eastern for kick"
Result: Deeper encoding through elaboration
```

### 4. Spaced Repetition

**The Science:**
Information reviewed at increasing intervals is retained better.

**Our Implementation:**
```typescript
confidenceGrowth: {
  firstEncounter: 30,
  afterContradiction: 50,
  afterTesting: 70,
  monthWithoutConflict: +5,
  stableFor6Months: 90
}
```

## 🎨 UI Components & Their Psychology

### Working Memory Sidebar

**Psychology Principle:** Miller's Law (7±2 capacity)

```jsx
<WorkingMemory>
  <CapacityIndicator>Working Memory: 5/7</CapacityIndicator>
  <ActiveIdeas>
    <Idea>Continental grip technique</Idea>
    <Idea>Weight distribution on serve</Idea>
    <Idea>Ball toss positioning</Idea>
    <!-- Maximum 9 items shown -->
  </ActiveIdeas>
  <ConsolidateButton>Save to Long-term Memory</ConsolidateButton>
</WorkingMemory>
```

### Knowledge Base Tabs

**Psychology Principle:** Distinct memory systems

```jsx
<KnowledgeBase>
  <Tab name="Episodic">
    📅 When You Learned
    <!-- Sessions with full context -->
  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Semantic">
    🧠 What You Know
    <!-- Decontextualized facts -->
  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Procedural">
    📋 How You Do It
    <!-- Step-by-step methods -->
  </Tab>
</KnowledgeBase>
```

### Understanding Evolution Timeline

**Psychology Principle:** Memory reconsolidation

```jsx
<EvolutionTimeline topic="Serve Technique">
  <Evolution date="Jan 1" confidence={30}>
    Continental grip for all serves
  </Evolution>
  <Evolution date="Feb 1" confidence={60}>
    Continental for flat, eastern for kick
  </Evolution>
  <Evolution date="Mar 1" confidence={85}>
    Grip less important than wrist angle
  </Evolution>
</EvolutionTimeline>
```

## 🔬 Cognitive Load Management

### Following Cognitive Load Theory

**1. Intrinsic Load (Complexity of Content)**
- Break complex ideas into chunks
- One contradiction at a time
- Progressive disclosure of details

**2. Extraneous Load (Poor Design)**
- Minimize by:
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Consistent patterns
  - Intuitive navigation

**3. Germane Load (Building Understanding)**
- Maximize by:
  - Contradiction resolution (active processing)
  - Evolution tracking (schema building)
  - Testing outcomes (integration)

**We're building a cognitive prosthetic that extends human memory using actual psychological principles.**

This isn't marketing - it's architecture. Every feature maps to real memory science.
