# Product Context & Requirements

## Product Vision

**Lumara:** A metacognitive AI partner that helps you build personal truth by tracking how your understanding evolves over time.

### The Core Innovation

**Track not just what sources say, but how YOU interpret them.**

```
Three Types of Truth:
â”œâ”€ External Truth (what sources say) â†’ ChatGPT/Claude do this
â”œâ”€ Collective Truth (what documents reveal) â†’ Supermemory does this
â””â”€ Personal Truth (what works for YOU) â†’ Only Lumara does this âœ¨
```

## The Fundamental Difference

### What Everyone Else Does
Store static information: "Coach said use continental grip"

### What Lumara Does
Track evolution of understanding:

```
Jan 1:  "Coach said continental grip"
        I understood: "Use for all serves"
        Tested: 40% success

Feb 1:  "Coach said continental grip" (same source!)
        I understood: "Only for flat serves"
        Tested: 70% success

Mar 1:  "Coach said continental grip" (same source!)
        I understood: "It's about wrist angle, not grip"
        Tested: 85% success

Personal Truth: Context-dependent technique with flexible wrist
Confidence: 85% (stable for 45 days)
```

**The source didn't change. Your understanding evolved. Only Lumara tracks that journey.**

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Metacognitive Awareness
**Show users HOW they think, not just what they think**

- Evolution timelines make thinking visible
- Confidence scores reveal certainty levels
- Contradiction alerts highlight conflicts
- Pattern discoveries surface blind spots

### 2. Local-First Privacy
**Data never leaves user's device**

- All AI processing client-side
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Offline-capable after setup
- No server tracking

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
**Simple on surface, powerful underneath**

- Start with simple memory capture
- Reveal evolution timeline when relevant
- Show patterns when discovered
- Advanced features opt-in

### 4. Confidence Over Quantity
**Quality of understanding matters more than volume**

- Confidence bars everywhere
- Test results affect scoring
- Decay warnings for old knowledge
- Encourage periodic review
