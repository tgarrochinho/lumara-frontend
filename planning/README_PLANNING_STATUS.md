## üìÅ Document Categories

### ‚úÖ Strategic Documents (KEEP)

**Core Strategy:**
- `NEXUSMIND_MASTER_STRATEGY.md` - Final consolidated strategy
- `COMPETITIVE_REALITY_CHECK.md` - Market analysis
- `MAKING_SENSE_OF_IT.md` - Conceptual clarity

**Product Definition Evolution:**
- `MEMORY_ALIGNMENT_WITH_VISION.md` - Shows how memory approach aligns with original vision
- `MEMORY_PLAYBOOKS_INTEGRATION.md` - How playbooks work in new model

### üé® UI/UX References (KEEP FOR IMPLEMENTATION)

**Use these when building:**
- `MEMORY_UI_ALTERNATIVES.md` - 5 different layout options (chose Adaptive Focus)
- `MEMORY_UI_COMPARISON.md` - Analysis of NotebookLM, ChatGPT, others
- `MEMORY_UI_VISUAL_MOCKUPS.md` - Detailed mockups with brand colors

### üóÑÔ∏è Archive (HISTORICAL REFERENCE)

**Original Memory Architecture (Superseded):**
- `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Original memory-based approach (before metacognitive pivot)
- `MEMORY_UI_DESIGN.md` - UI for pure memory approach
- `MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - 20-day plan for memory architecture

**Note:** These aren't wrong, but we've evolved beyond pure memory to metacognitive partner

### ‚ùå Documents NOT Created (User Rejected)

These were attempted but rejected during discussion:
- `MEMORY_USER_JOURNEY_CORRECT.md` - User journey attempts
- `NEXUSMIND_DIFFERENTIATORS.md` - Feature recommendations

## üéØ The Journey We Took Today

1. **Started:** Frustrated with RAG approach (artifacts, themes confusing)
2. **Explored:** Memory architecture based on psychology
3. **Discovered:** Supermemory already does memory for AI
4. **Pivoted:** To metacognitive partner (thinking quality, not quantity)
5. **Decided:** SaaS over MCP, multi-tenant over isolated
6. **Consolidated:** Into master strategy document

## üöÄ What to Do Next

### For Implementation:
1. Read `NEXUSMIND_MASTER_STRATEGY.md`
2. Reference `MEMORY_UI_ALTERNATIVES.md` for layout

4. Use adaptive focus design, not 3-column

### For Understanding:
1. Read `COMPETITIVE_REALITY_CHECK.md` for market context
2. Read `MAKING_SENSE_OF_IT.md` if conceptually confused

## üí° The One-Line Summary

**We're building a metacognitive AI partner that improves thinking quality through confidence scoring, contradiction tracking, and belief evolution - as a SaaS product with adaptive UI, not memory-focused MCP server.**
