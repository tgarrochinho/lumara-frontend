## 🚀 Upcoming Waves

### Wave 1: Understanding Evolution MVP (THE KILLER FEATURE)
**Status:** 🎯 Next Up
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Product differentiator
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Source:** `docs/UNDERSTANDING_EVOLUTION_MVP.md`
**PRD:** `/pm:prd-new understanding-evolution "Track how user understanding evolves over time - the killer differentiator"`

#### Why First?
This is what nobody else has. ChatGPT can't do this. Supermemory can't do this. This is Lumara's unique value proposition.

#### Features
1. **Evolution Timeline Visualization**
   - Visual timeline showing understanding changes
   - Trigger event markers (contradiction, practice, reflection)
   - Confidence trajectory graph
   - Breakthrough moment highlights

2. **Interpretation Tracking**
   - Capture user's understanding at each point
   - Link to source material (unchanging)
   - Track reinterpretations of same source
   - Show what caused each reinterpretation

3. **Confidence Scoring Algorithm**
   - Based on testing results (success rate)
   - Stability over time (how long unchanged)
   - Contradiction resolution count
   - Direct vs. indirect experience weighting

4. **Practice/Testing Tracking**
   - Record attempts and successes
   - Link results to interpretations
   - Auto-update confidence scores
   - Show improvement metrics

#### Technical Approach
- Extend existing Memory database schema
- Add `interpretations` array to Memory type
- Create timeline UI component (React + Framer Motion)
- Implement confidence calculation algorithm
- Build practice tracking system

#### Success Metrics
- Users can visualize 3+ evolution points
- Average confidence increase visible over time
- "Aha moment" - users see their thinking journey
- Feature demoed in <60 seconds

```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Can Run in Parallel:**
- Wave 5 (Contradiction UI) + Wave 6 (Duplication) - Different systems
- Wave 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 - Independent features

**Must Run Sequentially:**
- Wave 1 before Wave 2 - Evolution needs to be understood first
- Wave 2 before Wave 3 - Foundation before mechanics
- Wave 0.2 before Wave 7 - Provider abstraction must exist
