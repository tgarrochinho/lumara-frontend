## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Features to KEEP (Your Feedback)

### **✅ Keep Contradictions - Core Feature**

You're right! Contradictions are core to your app. Here's what we'll do:

**Week 1 Updated Plan:**
```
❌ OLD (my mistake): Remove Contradictions entirely
✅ NEW (correct):     Simplify Contradictions but keep core

What to Keep:
✅ Contradiction detection
✅ Resolution UI (ContradictionResolutionDecision)
✅ Contradiction types and service
✅ Core contradiction logic

What to Simplify:
- Simplify detection thresholds
- Streamline resolution UI (less steps)
- Reduce notification complexity
- Keep it fast and unobtrusive
```

### **✅ Keep Playbooks (Simplified)**

```
What to Keep:
✅ Playbook concept (guides/reports)
✅ Playbook generation
✅ Chapter structure

What to Simplify:
- Remove multi-stage review modal
- Simplify interview flow (fewer questions)
- Reduce update complexity
- Focus on 1-2 template types for MVP
```

### **❓ Concepts & DeepInsights - Your Call**

```
Option A: Keep but simplify
- Basic concept extraction only
- Simpler insight generation
- Less complex UI

Option B: Remove for MVP, add back later
- Focus on core insights (artifacts)
- Add back in Phase 2 if needed

Which do you prefer?
```

## 🗓️ This Week (Week 0): Foundation

### **Branch: `feature/mvp-foundation`**

**Goal:** Create foundation components before feature work

**Tasks:**

```bash
# 1. Create branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/mvp-foundation

# 2. Create foundation components (Day 1-2)
touch src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
touch src/components/ui/LoadingState.tsx
touch src/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx
touch src/utils/panelEvents.ts
touch src/components/registry.ts

# 3. Create new types (Day 3)
touch src/types/conversation.types.ts
touch src/types/insight.types.ts  
touch src/types/output.types.ts
touch src/types/topic.types.ts

# 4. Environment setup (Day 3)
touch .env.example

# 5. Implement components (Day 4-5)
# (I'll help you create these files)

# 6. Test & merge
npm test
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add MVP foundation components"
git push origin feature/mvp-foundation

# Create PR: feature/mvp-foundation → develop
```
