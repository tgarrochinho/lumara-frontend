# Layout & Polish

## Description

Final integration task to create a cohesive, polished user experience for the core user journey. This includes implementing a two-column layout, message bubbles for chat interactions, typing indicators, responsive design, and comprehensive end-to-end testing using Playwright.

This task brings together all previous tasks (37-31) into a unified, production-ready interface that delivers on Lumara's vision of a metacognitive AI partner.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Layout & Design
- [ ] Two-column layout implemented (chat left, memory/insights right)
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop (breakpoints: 640px, 1024px)
- [ ] Message bubbles styled with user/AI distinction
- [ ] Typing indicator shows when AI is generating response
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations throughout
- [ ] Dark mode support (respects system preference)
- [ ] Consistent spacing and typography per design system

### Polish & UX
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Error states with helpful messages and recovery actions
- [ ] Empty states with onboarding guidance
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts documented and functional (e.g., Cmd+K for quick actions)
- [ ] Focus management for accessibility
- [ ] Scroll behavior optimized (auto-scroll to new messages, preserve position on load)

### Performance
- [ ] Initial page load < 2 seconds
- [ ] Smooth scrolling with virtualization for long chat histories
- [ ] Optimized re-renders (React.memo, useMemo where appropriate)
- [ ] No layout shift (CLS < 0.1)
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90 for all categories

### Testing
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover complete user journey (signup → chat → memory creation → reflection)
- [ ] Playwright tests for all critical flows
- [ ] Visual regression tests for layout consistency
- [ ] Accessibility audit passes (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

### Documentation
- [ ] Component documentation updated
- [ ] User-facing help content added
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide updated
- [ ] Accessibility features documented

## Technical Details

### Two-Column Layout

```typescript
// Layout structure
<MainLayout>
  <LeftColumn> {/* Chat interface */}
    <ChatHeader />
    <MessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </LeftColumn>

  <RightColumn> {/* Memory & insights */}
    <MemoryPanel />
    <InsightsPanel />
    <ReflectionPanel />
  </RightColumn>
</MainLayout>
```

**Responsive behavior:**
- Mobile (<640px): Single column, swipeable tabs
- Tablet (640-1024px): Two columns, collapsible right panel
- Desktop (>1024px): Full two-column layout

### Message Bubbles

- User messages: Right-aligned, primary brand color
- AI messages: Left-aligned, neutral background
- Include avatar, timestamp, and actions (edit, delete, copy)
- Support markdown rendering for rich content
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

### Typing Indicator

```typescript
// Three-dot animation when AI is responding
<TypingIndicator visible={isAIResponding} />
```

### Component Integration

All components from Tasks 37-31 must work together seamlessly:

1. **Task 37 (Chat Interface)** → Left column
2. **Task 38 (Memory Management)** → Right column, top section
3. **Task 32 (RAG Integration)** → Powers chat responses
4. **Task 34 (Memory Recall)** → Highlights recalled memories in right column
5. **Task 36 (Reflection Prompts)** → Right column, bottom section
6. **Task 31 (Contradiction Detection)** → Alert banner across top

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Create comprehensive E2E test suite:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/core-journey.spec.ts
test('complete user journey', async ({ page }) => {
  // 1. Sign up
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/signup');
  await fillSignupForm(page);

  // 2. Chat interaction
  await sendMessage(page, 'I love hiking in the mountains');
  await expectAIResponse(page);

  // 3. Memory creation
  await expectMemoryCreated(page, 'hiking');

  // 4. Memory recall
  await sendMessage(page, 'What outdoor activities do I enjoy?');
  await expectMemoryRecalled(page, 'hiking');

  // 5. Reflection prompt
  await expectReflectionPrompt(page);

  // 6. Contradiction detection
  await sendMessage(page, 'I hate outdoor activities');
  await expectContradictionAlert(page);
});
```

### Accessibility Audit

- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels and roles properly assigned
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Screen reader testing with VoiceOver/NVDA
- No keyboard traps
- Skip navigation links

### Files to Create/Modify

**New files:**
- `src/components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/layouts/TwoColumnLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx`
- `src/components/chat/TypingIndicator.tsx`
- `src/styles/animations.css`
- `tests/e2e/core-journey.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/responsive.spec.ts`

**Modified files:**
- All component files from Tasks 37-31 (integration adjustments)
- `src/styles/globals.css` (layout utilities, animations)
- `tailwind.config.js` (custom breakpoints, animations)

## Dependencies

**Depends on ALL previous tasks:**
- Task 37 (Chat Interface)
- Task 38 (Memory Management UI)
- Task 32 (RAG Integration)
- Task 34 (Memory Recall Integration)
- Task 36 (Reflection Prompts UI)
- Task 31 (Contradiction Detection UI)

**Conflicts with:**
- Task 32 (RAG Integration) - layout changes may require RAG component adjustments
- Task 36 (Reflection Prompts UI) - positioning and space allocation conflicts

**Note:** This task CANNOT start until all dependent tasks are complete and merged.

## Effort Estimate

**Total: 1.5 days (12 hours)**

- Layout implementation: 3 hours
- Message bubbles & typing indicator: 1.5 hours
- Responsive design: 2 hours
- Integration of all components: 2 hours
- E2E test suite: 2 hours
- Accessibility audit & fixes: 1 hour
- Polish, animations, performance: 0.5 hours
