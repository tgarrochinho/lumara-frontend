# Issue #5 - Configure Development Tools

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully configured ESLint and Prettier for the Lumara frontend project with full integration and no conflicts between tools.

## Work Completed

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed Prettier: `prettier@3.6.2`
- Installed ESLint-Prettier integration:
  - `eslint-config-prettier@10.1.8` (disables conflicting ESLint rules)
  - `eslint-plugin-prettier@5.5.4` (runs Prettier as ESLint rule)
- Installed ESLint plugins:
  - `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.5` (React-specific linting rules)

### 2. Configuration Files Created

#### .prettierrc
- Semi: false (no semicolons)
- Single quotes: true
- Tab width: 2 spaces
- Trailing commas: ES5 compatible
- Print width: 80 characters
- Arrow parens: avoid (when possible)

#### .prettierignore
Ignores build outputs, dependencies, and cache directories:
- node_modules
- dist/build/.next/out
- .cache/.parcel-cache/.turbo
- coverage
- Lock files

#### eslint.config.js (Updated)
- Integrated Prettier as an ESLint plugin
- Added React plugin with proper configuration
- Configured TypeScript rules
- Set up React Hooks rules
- Disabled conflicting rules (react-in-jsx-scope, prop-types)
- Configured unused variable warnings with `_` prefix ignore pattern
- Added proper ignores for build outputs

#### .vscode/settings.json
- Format on save: enabled
- Default formatter: Prettier
- ESLint auto-fix on save
- TypeScript workspace SDK configuration
- File exclusions for better performance

#### .gitignore (Updated)
- Added exception to track `.vscode/settings.json` for team consistency

### 3. Package.json Scripts
Added comprehensive scripts for linting and formatting:
```json
{
  "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --fix",
  "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css,md}\"",
  "format:check": "prettier --check \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css,md}\""
}
```

### 4. Testing & Verification
- Ran `npm run lint` - All checks pass with 0 warnings
- Ran `npm run format:check` - All files use Prettier code style
- Ran `npm run lint:fix` - Successfully auto-fixed formatting issues
- Verified integration between ESLint and Prettier (no conflicts)
- All existing code properly formatted and passes linting

## Files Modified/Created

### Configuration Files
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/.prettierrc` (created)
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/.prettierignore` (created)
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/.vscode/settings.json` (created)
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/eslint.config.js` (updated)
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/.gitignore` (updated)
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/vite.config.ts` (formatted)
- `/Users/tgarrochinho/Code/lumara-frontend/package.json` (scripts added)

### Source Files Formatted
- All TypeScript and TSX files in `src/` formatted according to Prettier rules
- Fixed trailing commas, semicolons, quotes, and indentation
- Ensured consistent code style across the codebase

## Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✓
- [x] ESLint installed and configured with React and TypeScript rules
- [x] Prettier installed and configured
- [x] ESLint + Prettier integration working without conflicts
- [x] .vscode/settings.json created for consistent editor behavior
- [x] npm scripts added for lint and format commands
- [x] Linting runs successfully on existing code (0 warnings/errors)
- [x] Formatting runs successfully on existing code

## Coordination Notes
During parallel execution with agents 4, 6, and 7:
- Agent 7 (Zustand) committed ESLint/Prettier configuration as part of their work
- Configuration was identical to planned setup from requirements
- All agents now benefit from unified linting and formatting
- No merge conflicts occurred due to proper file ownership coordination

## Next Steps
Development tools are fully configured. Developers can now:
1. Rely on automatic formatting on save (VS Code)
2. Run `npm run lint` before committing
3. Use `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix issues
4. Use `npm run format` to format all files
5. All code will maintain consistent style automatically

## Dependencies
- Issue #3: Project Foundation ✓ (completed)
- Issue #4: TypeScript Configuration ✓ (completed)

## Commit
Changes were committed as part of Issue #7 (Zustand configuration) by Agent 7, who was working in parallel and included the development tools configuration.
